# Summary
What are institutional factors that may positively influence FDI?
What do we know about the drivers of FDI in low-income countries? 
The available literature confirms the importance of FDI, mostly in the context of economic and social development. 
A growing number of empirical papers refer mostly to economic aspects that may matter in this perspective. 
At the same time we know quite little about various institutions that may affect FDI. 
In this paper we use econometric and machine learning apparatus to verify the relevance of constitutional compliance for FDI in low-income countries. 
The results imply that indeed constitutional compliance is relevant in this context, but this finding is subject to various caveats in economic modeling. 
Our conclusions may be also useful for policymakers.
